\section{Theory}
The Similarity Search Problem has many variations and uses. The general idea is to find some data point from a set of datapoints that is the most similar to some query point according to some similarity metric. The LSH framework, one of the first big breakthroughs in this field, regards points in a $d$-dimensional space and uses the Manhattan distance between them as a similarity metric - two points that are close together are regarded as more similar\cite{classic-lsh}. In this project, we will regard the similarity between sets and use the Jaccard similarity $J(A,B)=\frac{|A\cap B|}{|A\cup B|}$ as our similarity metric. The Jaccard similarity produces a number between 0 and 1, where a larger number indicates more similarity between the two sets.\\
This part will first define the problem to be considered in a concise way - then describe the existing solutions in general to the context of the parallel bit counting algorithm, described in the next section to set the context for the rest of the report.
