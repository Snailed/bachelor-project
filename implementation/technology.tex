\subsection{Technology}
The implementation to be measured upon has been written in Rust, a memory safe, fast, compiled programming language\cite{rust-lang} that has great tooling and typing for writing, testing and benchmarking algorithms.\\
It uses the \texttt{rustc} compiler with a \texttt{LLVM} compilation back-end. It does not use a garbage collector but relies on compile time borrow checking, which leads to a language that is comparable to or faster than C\cite{highleveldrivers}.\\
The binary to be benchmarked is compiled and run on a laptop workstation as described in appendix \ref{appendix:machine-specs}.
The code for the implementation is available in appendix B.
