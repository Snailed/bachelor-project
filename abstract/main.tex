    % This project regards an analysis, implementation and comparison of existing efficient solutions to the Approximate Jaccard Similarity Search Problem of estimating the Jaccard Similarity between multiple sets. The findings include both a large theoretical and practical advantage of using advanced methods as presented by Dahlgaard et al.\cite{dahlgaard2017fast} and Knudsen\cite{fast-similarity-search} if the user is willing to pre-process the search-corpus before performing the search. This comparison both regards the precision of different methods as well as the running time of an real-world implementation. This is based on an implementation written in a low-level systems language and benchmarked on a regular personal computer with a statistical significance. Furthermore, reflections are made on how the results might scale on more specialized hardware.
    This project regards an analysis of recent advances in solving the Approximate Jaccard Similarity Search Problem, specifically in regards to how one can achieve sublinear query time using parallel bit counting as presented by Knudsen\cite{fast-similarity-search}. This contains a theoretical analysis of both time complexity and proof of correctness of the bit-counting algorithm as well as an empirical comparison to existing methods. 
    The findings include a theoretical time advantage to using parallel bit counting compared to a simple, linear time algorithm, but empirical results show that this advantage is hard to achieve in practice. 
    Furthermore, reflections are made on how the results might scale on more specialized hardware.
